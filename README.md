```lindblad-sp``` provides code to calculate linear and non-linear response properties of open quantum systems governed by a single-particle (quadratic) Lindblad master equation.

```example-rice-mele``` provides test cases for the functions provided as class member functions of ```LindbladBoseSP``` and ```LindbladFermiSP``` with the Rice-Mele model for a 1D tight-binding chain. Sample response functions include

- Density
- Spectral function
- Energy bands and relaxation rates
- Diamagnetic linear response
- Paramagnetic linear response
- Nonlinear optical response (shift/second harmonic generation)

This code is related to the paper [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41535-024-00709-4][S. Talkington and M. Claassen, npj Quantum Materials 9, 104 (2024)].
